# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> The aim of this project is to develop a CNN model that can precisely identify melanoma, a type of cancer that can be fatal if not detected early. Melanoma contributes to 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. An automated system that can assess images and promptly notify dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to significantly reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis.

## General Information

- This project focuses on developing a CNN model for accurately detecting melanoma, a type of skin cancer that is responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management of melanoma.

- The project utilizes a dataset consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The dataset is divided into nine classes of skin diseases, including actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus, pigmented benign keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and vascular lesion.

- The business problem that this project aims to address is the need for an automated system that can accurately detect melanoma and alert dermatologists about its presence. This can reduce the manual effort and time required for diagnosis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.

## Conclusions

- The initial CNN model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%, which can be further improved by increasing the model's depth and optimizing hyperparameters such as the optimizer choice.
- Class rebalancing techniques such as data augmentation have shown to be effective in improving the model's accuracy.
- After rectifying class imbalances, there was no evidence of overfitting or underfitting of the model.
- The development of an automated system for the detection of melanoma using CNN models has the potential to significantly reduce the manual effort and time required for diagnosis, leading to improved patient outcomes.
